# Fire-detection-Computer-vision-

This project detects fire in images using a deep learning model based on the Xception CNN architecture. It classifies images as fire or non-fire by applying preprocessing, segmentation, and feature extraction techniques. The system can be extended for real-time fire detection in surveillance, industrial safety, and wildfire monitoring. Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/phylake1337/fire-dataset
